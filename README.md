# Rasa_with_Botium

Having created a [slackbot with GCP](http://github.com/mramshaw/GCP-Slackbot), [Alexa Skills](http://github.com/mramshaw/Alexa-Stuff), 
and [Google Assistant Apps](http://github.com/mramshaw/Google-Assistant), it seemed to be time to have a look at [Rasa](http://rasa.com/)
and [Botium](http://www.botium.at/).

Rasa and Botium are both Open-Source. Rasa is a general chatbot framework, while Botium is a generic chatbot testing framework.

Both can be added into existing frameworks via external linkages called ___webhooks___.

## Privacy

For my slackbot I used __Wit.ai__ - which is owned by __Facebook__.

For my Alexa Skills I used __Alexa__ - which is owned by __Amazon__.

For my Google Assistant Apps I used __Dialogflow__ - which is owned by __Google__.

For anyone remotely concerned about privacy, being able to track user data and
how it is processed via Open-Source code is definitely worth considering.
